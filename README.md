## Description

This project is based on the idea of
the [Presence One](https://shop.everythingsmart.io/en-de/products/everything-presence-one-kit).
I made my own, less expensive, modular & open-source version of it.

This board covers all the features of the original, plus these extras:

- swappable modules
- open-source
- additional sensors
    - air pressure
    - air quality (IAQ)
    - COÂ² equivalent
    - breath VOC equivalent

- modular
- less expensive
- customizable

Supported sensors are listed in the documentation:
[Sensor Modules](https://github.com/Schluggi/AIOsense/wiki/How-to-start%3F#3-sensor-modules)

## What does it look like? ðŸ‘€

### Schematic

You can find the schematic [here](schematic/AIOsense.pdf).

## Power consumption

The power consumption depends on your configuration. On a fully equipped Board (ESP32-C3 + mmWave + PIR + BME280 +
LightSensor) we measured an idle power consumption of **0.45W / 0.09A** some peaks around **0.78W / 0.15A**.

Without a mmWave sensor the idle power consumption is around **0.11W / 0.02A** and peak near **0.45W / 0.09A**.
