# Quickstart

## Order PCB

First of all you need the PCB. We recommend PCBWay because it's the most straight forward experience. Just click on the
link and take your order (you can also use [this link³](https://pcbway.com/g/DFb536) for register to get 5$ off on your
first order). But you can actually choose any PCB manufacturer.
Please notice that not all of them have the same capabilities. We tried to make our PCB as generic as possible, it
should work for most of them but try this at your own risk.

- [PCBWay³](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/AIOsense_All_In_One_Sensor_132c1507.html)
- [Aisler](https://aisler.net/p/TWDRHBSM)

For all other manufacturer (like [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)) please upload the zip file which you can find at
the [release](https://github.com/Schluggi/AIOsense/releases/latest) page.

## Order CPU

Next up you need a [CPU](cpu.md) to drive the board. We recommend
an [ESP32-C3](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005004740051202.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2deu).

## Order sensors

Take a look at the [sensors](sensors.md) page and pick what you want.

## Other parts

For a fully assembled board you will also need some pin headers.

You also need two 4K7 Ohm resistors if you want to use the SMD version of the BME
modules ([and only then](../debugging))!

## Assembly

Should be easy and self explainable.

## Flash ESPHome

## Further steps (optional)

- [Integrate Home Assistant](homeassistant.md).
- Print a case (wip)
